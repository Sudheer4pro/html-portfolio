<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, 
  a field that fascinates me with its potential to create innovative and impactful solutions for 
  real-world problems. I am also passionate about cybersecurity and database management system, 
  two areas that complement my AI and ML knowledge and skills. 


  
<p>I have demonstrated my proficiency and creativity in these domains by obtaining certifications 
  from FUTURECALLS TECHNOLOGY PRIVATE LIMITED and NPTEL, and by participating in projects and hackathons
   that challenge me and allow me to collaborate with others. For example, I developed a chatbot using Python 
   and Dialogflow that can answer queries related to the university's courses, facilities, and admission process,
    and I used machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of diabetes based on various factors. My goal is 
    to become a skilled and innovative AI and ML engineer in the future, and to contribute to the advancement 
    of technology and society. I am eager to learn new skills and technologies, and to explore new opportunities 
    and challenges in the field of AI and ML.</p>
